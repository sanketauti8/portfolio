Users can easily view all available campgrounds and check prices based on the number of people they plan to book for. Additionally, they can see which campsites are currently available and make bookings directly through the platform. This project was created using React for the front end, Node, Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.",

          "I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a movie dataset using Hadoop, Pyspark, and AWS technologies. Through descriptive analysis, I extracted valuable insights and presented them using 11 graphical representations. By ensuring data accuracy and consistency, I enhanced the quality of generated reports by 15%. Leveraging AWS services, I stored the dataset in an S3 bucket and utilized EMR, resulting in an 80% acceleration in processing time for a 2GB dataset. This project showcases my ability to handle large-scale data analytics effectively and optimize processing efficiency.",
